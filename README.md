# VectorMap2Opendrive
Convert Autoware vector map to Opendrive format.

This is a demo project about converting vector map to opendrive. So far it only supports 'dtlane', 'lane', 'point' and 'node' and uses 'Planeline' (Base on OpenDRIVE_1.4H.xsd) to generate opendrive. (Thus the opendrive file size is quite big.)

#### **How to use it**:
1.  Copy 'dtlane.csv' 'lane.csv' 'point.csv' and 'node.csv' into 'VectorMap' folder.
2.  Open VectorMap2Opendrive.sln with VS2017.
3.  Compile solution and run it, then new opendrive file will be generated and locate in 'OpenDrive' folder.
4.  OpenDRIVE_1.4H.cs is auto-generated by xsd.exe based on OpenDRIVE_1.4H.xsd
